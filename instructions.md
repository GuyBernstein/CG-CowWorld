# Computer Graphics Project

## Project Definition

You must build a program in OpenGL that renders a cow grazing in a meadow that the user can control.

Build a 3D world containing a cow in a meadow, trees, and several different objects. 

This world should have ambient lighting and a point light source. The cow's movement should be controllable through the user interface.

Try to be creative in building the world.

```
The Cow World:
on a meadow (an infinite/large area of grass or herbage) and at least three other objects (such as trees, animals, buildings, lampposts, etc.).
At least one of the objects must appear metallic.
```
• Build the cow using a tail, legs, ears, nose, and eyes. The cow should have a head, body, balls/ellipses/etc. Make it as realistic as possible.<br>
• First use ambient lighting to illuminate the scene.<br>
• Add menus. The menu options should include "adjust ambient light" , "quit" and "help". 
When the user selects "adjust ambient light", you should prompt the user for new ambient values, and adjust the ambient light accordingly.
The "help" option should explain each mouse and keyboard control.<br>
• The cow should turn and move according to the user's instructions.<br>
• The cow's head will move left and right and move up and down according to the user's instructions.<br>
• The tail will move left and right, up and down according to the user's instructions.<br>
• The legs will move according to user instructions (optional).
• Add light sources and reflective surface properties. There should be at least one point light source. The user should be able to adjust the intensity, position, and direction of the light source.<br>
• (Optional). Add texture mapping<br>
• The user interface should be as convenient and user-friendly as possible.

## Camera control

• Add controls so the user can set the position and orientation of the viewpoint.<br>
• Allow the user to change the perspective so that they see the world through the eyes of the cow. The view will change as the cow moves.
