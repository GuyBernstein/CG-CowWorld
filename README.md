# CG-CowGL
CowGL is my solution for the final project in Computer Graphics (20562) course. It is an interactive rendering of a cow. </br>
The cow is located in a world which has a few objects in it (trees, house, etc.) and a lighting model. </br>
The user can control the movement of the cow, camera positioning and the lighting of the scene.
